# üå¶Ô∏è Weather Forecasting Application using Python & Streamlit

This project is a weather forecasting application developed using **Python** with a **Streamlit-based front end**. It predicts the likelihood of rainfall based on user input of **temperature**, **humidity**, and **wind speed**. The system uses **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** models trained on **two years of weather data** from **Pune, India**.
